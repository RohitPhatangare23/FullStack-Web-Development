    <h2>SEO = Search engine optimization (Want website rank top)</h2>
    Coding a great site is just the first step in building a successful and popular web presence. Once you have your
    website live on the web, you need for visitors to find it.
    While you could boost traffic to your site by placing advertisements on social networks and the search engine
    results page (SERP) of search engines like Google, Bing, and Yahoo!, all of those traffic sources will cost you
    money â€“ a resource which may not be plentiful when you are first getting started.
    As a result, the vast majority of popular websites depend on organic search engine traffic: free traffic coming from
    search engines as visitors find a website after querying a search engine
    Search engine optimization, or SEO, is the process of improving your website so that it achieves a higher ranking in
    search engine SERPs, and so that more search engine users click on your website listing in the search engine
    results.
